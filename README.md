# Practical Deep Learning course | Training 100% working on Consumer GPUs via torch-directml on Windows OS
[Practical Deep Learning Course](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) by [Jeremy Howard](https://github.com/jph00) (Big big thank you for creating this)

## Graphics card support
The **[torch-directml](https://pypi.org/project/torch-directml/)** expects DirectX 12 which is supported on graphics cards from NVIDIA's Fermi architecture and later, AMD's GCN-based chips, and Intel's Haswell and newer processors.

The table below shows the (theoretical) support matrix -

| Manufacturer | Supported Models |
|--------------|------------------|
| NVIDIA | GeForce GTX 600 series and newer |
| AMD | Radeon HD 7000 series and newer |
| Intel | Intel HD Graphics 5000 series and newer |
